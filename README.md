# FCC-Survey-Form

Goal:

* The purpose of this project is to create a functional survey form similar to this:  https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks

Demo: 

* Follow this link to view the current state of my project: https://codepen.io/mhz_777/pen/MWVowXg

Skills Used:
* HTML5
* CSS

Project Specifications:

   * You should have a page title in an h1 element with an id of title
   * You should have a short explanation in a p element with an id of description
   * You should have a form element with an id of survey-form
   * Inside the form element, you are required to enter your name in an input field that has an id of name and a type of text
   * Inside the form element, you are required to enter your email in an input field that has an id of email
   * If you enter an email that is not formatted correctly, you will see an HTML5 validation error
   * Inside the form, you can enter a number in an input field that has an id of number
   * If you enter non-numbers in the number input, you will see an HTML5 validation error
   * If you enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, you will see an HTML5 validation error
   * For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see corresponding label elements in the form, that describe the purpose of each field with the       following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label"
   * For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see placeholder text that gives a description or instructions for each field
   * Inside the form element, you should have a select dropdown element with an id of dropdown and at least two options to choose from
   * Inside the form element, you can select an option from a group of at least two radio buttons that are grouped using the name attribute
   * Inside the form element, you can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute
   * Inside the form element, you are presented with a textarea for additional comments
   * Inside the form element, you are presented with a button with id of submit to submit all the inputs
   
Challenges Faced:

   * Making design flow w.r.t background image
   * Not applying opacity to child elements, but rather just the parent
   * How to style the indiviual fields in the form section to appear as desired


New Things Learned:

   * pre-sketching a design in FIGMA allows me to experiment with different designs without having to code anything
   * rgba allows to apply opacity just to the parent
   * nesting the label and input tags allow the elements to appear in the same line rather than separately
